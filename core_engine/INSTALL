FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS AT YOUR OWN RISK!
NOTE:
These set of instructions are meant for those who download the source and run it directly.
The actual setup script will perform all the given activities for an end user using GNUKhata for production.

Basic Installation
==================
Gnukhata depends on the following components and they should be installed for the software to be functional.
For the Core engine:
	*postgresql for the database, version 8.4 or 9X, 9 series highly recommended
	*sqlite3 needed for suplimentary data 
	* Python, version 2.5 or 2.6, version 2.7 Highly recommended for stability 
	*python-psycopg2 for the database connectivity and interfacing between python and postgresql.
	*python-twisted for the xmlrpc service
For the client application 


For checkout of source code:
*mercurial for getting (pulling ) the code and committing changes.


First install the dependencies for compiling psycopg2, twisted and sqlalchemy library.  
You will also need to install the dependencies for compiling nginx web server for production use.
On a sudo based distro of GNULinux such as Ubuntu, use the command given below.
sudo apt-get install -y --force-yes  libpcre3 libpcre3-dev libpq5 libpq-dev
you can use yum install as a super user on an rpm based Distro such as Centos, Redhat or Fedora.

Once the dependencies are sorted out,  download and compile python version 2.6 or 2.7.
NOTE: AS MENTIONED ABOVE IN DEPENDENCIES, PYTHON 2.7 MUST BE USED FOR STABILITY and SECURITY!

go to www.python.org and from the download section get the source tarball for python 2.7
extract the content of the tarball and then cd to the python-2.7 directory. 
now, issue the following 3 commands exactly as given.
./configure --prefix=/opt/gnukhata
make
sudo make install

This process will takesome time so be patient.

if Python version 2.7 is the default on your system, just change the #bang in the gkstart file from the core_engine directory.
the first line in gkstart looks like this by default 
#!/usr/bin/python27
change it to #!/usr/bin/python if version 2.7 is on your machine by default.

if you install python 2.7 with the given process, make a symlink in /user/bin as follows.
sudo ln -s /opt/gnukhata/bin/python /usr/bin/python27


once this has completed download the source code for postgresql.
We highly recommend version 9 or above for better performance and security.
go to www.postgresql.org and download the source tarball.

follow the same process with postgresql as you did with python compilation with one exception 
in this case your ./configure should look like as follows.
./configure --prefix=/opt/gnukhata --without-readline

as you must have understood you will issue make and sudo make install after ./configure.

 

after the install process completes, initialise the data folder for holding all databases.
for this follow the below given instructions exactly as you see.
note that every command is on a single line so you will have to press enter for every command.

sudo mkdir /opt/gnukhata/data
sudo useradd postgres
sudo chown postgres  /opt/gnukhata/data
sudo su postgres
/opt/gnukhata/bin/initdb -D /opt/gnukhata/data
exit

Now create a symlink to postgres server and createdb command.

sudo ln -s /opt/gnukhata/bin/postgres /usr/bin/postgres
please remove postgres from usr/bin if you had a previous installation of the same.
for this issue sudo rm /user/bin/postgres
do the same for createdb
sudo ln -s /opt/gnukhata/bin/createdb /usr/bin/createdb


now create the gnukhata user in postgres

for this we have to start the postgres server
type sudo su -c "postgres -D /opt/gnukhata/data & " postgres and hit enter
hit enter again to get the prompt back.
now for creating a user you have to run the psql client.

for this type /opt/gnukhata/bin/psql -U postgres template1
on the template one prompt type create user gnukhata with password 'gnukhata'; and type enter
now enter grant all privileges on database template1 to gnukhata; and hit enter.

type \q and hit enter
congratulations!
GNUKhata server is ready to be used.
to start GNUKhata type sudo ./gkstart from the core_engine directory.
Note that every time you start gnukhata core engine, you will first have to start the postgres server.
 
as mentioned before type sudo su -c "postgres -D /opt/gnukhata/data & " postgres and hit enter.
