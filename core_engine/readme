GNUKhata is a Free accounting software aimed to be modular, robust, scalable and customisable.

The System uses a postgresql database server and totally coded in python with ui in PYGTK and the core logic implemented as xmlrpc service through the twisted library.
What this implies is that GNUKhata is made available as a middle layer service and any front end whether desktop based or web based can be built as a thin client.

GNUKhata is in its very early stage of development and has tuns of bugs.
currently we are actively working on a web front end which is expected to be the first stable client application.
We recommend only testers and developres use the software in its current stage.
see the INSTALL file for details on dependencies and installation instructions.
