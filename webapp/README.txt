This is the source for GNUKhata's web based front end.
It has been designed with Pylons where the control logic makes calls to the rpc based core engine.
We highly recommend to run this web application using python 2.7 and Pylons 1.0.
If you Install Python 2.7 in /opt/gnukhata/bin then paster will also be present in the same directory.
So run /opt/gnukhata/bin/paster serve development.ini.
Alternatively you might have installed Python and paster elsewhere which you can symlink to /usr/bin.
NOTE:
All latest distros of GNU/Linux come with Python 2.7 as default.
So you nither need to install it your self nor create any symlinks.
Such distros include Ubuntu 11.04 onwards and latest fedora versions.

This webapp also gets installed automatically through the installer available on our website www.gnukhata.org
