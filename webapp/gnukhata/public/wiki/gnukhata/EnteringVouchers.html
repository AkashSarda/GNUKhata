After creating accounts, we come to recording of transactions.<br>
<br>
Here you can enter different types of transactions such as Contra, Journal, Payment, Receipt, Credit Note, Debit Note, Sales, Purchase, Sales Return, Purchase Return <br>

and there is one more that is Other.In this you can define your own transaction.<br>
<br>
Let us take Contra voucher. The record of this voucher involves two accounts from Current Assets, Sub Group Cash and  Bank. <br>
<br>
The first text-box is for Reference Number. This is important because you can use this for finding a record in Find/Edit Voucher<br>.
<br>
This text-box can take alphanumeric characters.So I type CA12. Next comes the Date field, it is to be entered in DD-MM-YYYY manner. I type 01-02-2011.<br>
<br>
For recording a voucher you have to fill the table appearing on the screen. This table contains four fields. <br>
<br>
The first is Dr/Cr. Here you have a drop-down box with Dr/Cr options. Depending upon whether you want to debit or credit an account you will select DR or CR option.<br>
<br>
I have selected Dr option. <br>
<br>
Next field is Account Name. Here also you have a dropdown box. It shows created account names. I have selected Cash account. <br>
<br>
The next is Debit Amount, here in the textbox you are supposed to enter amount. I have entered 2000. Then I pressed Ok button to indicate that this part of the record 
of the transaction is correct.<br>
<br>
Now we see second part of the transaction that is credit side. Now I select Credit option from this dropdown. From the Account Name I select HDFC Bank.<br>
<br>
Because I have selected Credit option from the first dropdown. The amount will be entered in credit column. I entered 2000. Then pressed Ok button.<br>
<br>
At this point if you realise that there is a mistake in the data entered, you can Edit that row by pressing the Edit symbol which appears in that row.<br>
<br>
When you do this you can re-enter the data. If you want to delete the row, you press the delete symbol.<br>
<br>
If the data is entered correctly total of debit amounts and credit amounts will be equal.<br>
<br>
Now we come to Narration box, here you can write whatever details of the transaction.<br>I type "Being cash withdrawn from bank". When you are done with this you can <br>
press the Save button. <br>
<br>
See what happens When I press Save button. Here I get to get record another transaction but at the top of this message shown "Record has been saved".<br>
<br>
Now I will show you how to find a record. This can be done by  entering reference number or by entering date of transaction.<br>
<br>
I choose Reference no. So here I enter Reference No CA12. Now you will realise the importance of entering unique reference number.<br>
<br>
Let us search a transaction by date of transaction. IF you are not certain about the date of transaction you can enter period in the form of From date - To date.<br>
<br>
Here I enter 01-02-2011. For To date field I enter 28-02-2011.<br>
<br>
See what happens When I press Search button. The programme has identify the transaction. <br>
<br>
It has displayed the data of the transaction in the form of Reference No, Voucher type, Date of transaction and Narration.<br>
<br>
If you want to see details of the transaction you can press the View button. When I press the view button the entire transaction is displayed on the screen.  <br>
<br>
Below this you will notice three buttons, namely, save to file, Edit and clone. <br>
<br>
When I press save to file button. Here you are, the programme generates a PDF file of the record. As you know a PDF file can be printed. <br>
<br>
