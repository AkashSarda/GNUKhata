 we will cover how to create templates under GNUKhata.<br>
<br>
In Master you have one option that is Create Template. Whe<br>n you select this option you can create new Template.  See what happens when I select this option.
<br>
We are presented with a new screen. <br>
<br>
The template created here is used for entering transcations of a repeatative nature.<br>
<br>
For example if you have a large number of salary vouchers, you may create a tempalate for salary payment voucher.<br>
<br>
I will show you how to do this. Here you see the textbox at the top for the name of the template. I enter salary paym<br>ent.
<br>
Next box ask you to select the type of voucher. This dropdown gives you a list of different types of vouchers.<br>
<br>
For this I select payment. Next you have to choose account name from the dropdown box. I choose salary account. <br>Sincethis account will always be debited, 
<br>
I choose Dr from the next dropdown box.<br>
<br>
Then I press the OK button. <br>
<br>
At the bottom you see a four colomn table. First colomn is for check box, the second is for Voucher type , Third is for Account and the last is for Dr or Cr.  <br>
<br>
Here you see one row added, which shows the Voucher type as payment, Name of the the account as cash and that it will be debited.<br>
<br>
Now you have to select the second part of the transaction. For this I will choose the account name HDFC bank and it will be credited. Then I press OK button. <br>see here a second raw is added in the following table. <br>Now I will add one more account and that will be debited. Here I choose ICICI bank which will be debited. <br>
<br>
When I press OK button. a row will be added to the table.<br>
<br>
If the entered data is not correct, I select the checkbox for that row.<br> A select mark appears there. Then I press remove button to remove the selected row. <br>
<br>
The final step in creating voucher template is to press the submit button.<br>
<br>
See what happens when I press the submit button. A massage appers at the saying voucher template created. you can create as many templates as you want.<br>
<br>
Thats it for this tutorial. <br>
