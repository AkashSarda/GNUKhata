Deploying and  basic house keeping.<br>

Hello and welcome to this series of spoken tutorials on GNUKhata.<br>

GNUKhata (http://gnukhata.org) is a free and open source accounting software. It is suitable both for small organisations and for enterprises.<br>

In this comprehensive series of spoken tutorials, we will cover all aspects of accounting under GNUKhata.<br>

So let's get started!<br>
<br>
The most basic activity in GNUKhata is to register an organisation for a financial year so as to generate its books of accounts.<br>
<br>
what I will show you now.<br>
<br>
since we are using the web application version of GNUKhata, we will open our favourite web browser. <br>
<br>
I use Firefox, but GNUKhata can be run on other browsers as well, such as chromium, safari etc.<br>
<br>
In the address bar, I type http://localhost:8080 like this.<br>
<br>
As you can see GNUKhata's first screen appears on the desktop. <br>
<br>
Here you see that there are two options. First is for selecting an organisation and the second is for creating a new organisation.<br>
<br>
so lets go for the Create New Organisation. Hence I choose create New organisation option.<br>
<br>
Here in the textbox i write the name of the company IITB.<br>
<br>
Then I have to choose between an NGO or a profit making organisation. I select NGO as my option. <br>
<br>
Now we have to enter the financial year in the form of from date To to date. I enter 1-02-2010 to 1-03-2011<br>.
<br>
After this I press Next button.<br>
<br>
Here as you can see the name of<br> the organisation and the chosen financial year appears at the top.
<br>
Now if you desire you can enter<br> information such as the address, contact details etc.
<br>
For now I will choose not to en<br>ter any of these details as all of them are optional.
<br>
Let's now press skip button.<br>
<br>
As you can perceive we have to <br>wait for some time, because the database is being created.
<br>
There you are! <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Having created an organisation, we choose to create accounts.<br>
<br>
Now you see a number of textboxes.<br>
<br>
The first is Group name. Here you click on dropdown you get to see all Group names provided by the software. All you have to do is to select a group name. Here I <br>
<br>
choose Current Asset as Group name.<br>
<br>
After selecting Group name you have to select subgroup name. These subgroups are also provided by the software. I choose bank as a sud group name. Here you have an <br>
<br>
option to create a new subgroup as per your requirement.<br>
<br>
When you select create new subgroup option a new textbox appears on the screen. Here you will enter name of the subgroup which you want to create.<br>
<br>
Next filed is Account name, here I enter the name of the Account name called salary.<br>
<br>
Of the main groups sum will have opening balances, while incomes and expenses will not have opening balance.<br>
<br>
for groups like capital, current liability, loans(liability), the accounts will have opening credit balance and for groups like current assets fixed assets , loans<br>
(assest) the accounts will have opening debite balance.<br>
<br>
As the name suggest Total credit opening balance gives you the total of all credit opening balances so far entered. <br>
<br>
similarly  Total debit opening balance gives you the total of all debit opening balances so far entered. <br>
<br>
Difference in opening balance gives differance between debit and credit opening balances.<br>
<br>
If all the opening balances correctly entered,this will be zero.<br>
<br>
While entering opening debit or credit balance you can enter zero, press the enter key, enter any positive or negative amount. I enter 5000.<br>
<br>
If you enter a negative amount in the opening balance, it will change the type of opening balance from debit to credit or vice versa.  <br>
<br>
After filling all the data I press save button.<br>
<br>
Here you are, message appears at the top. It tells you have successfully created the desired account.<br>
<br>
If you do not desire to create any more accounts, then select Finish option.<br>
<br>
Congratulations! you have now created the books for the organisation IITB. <br>
<br>
Here a new screen appears and you are asked for password.<br>
<br>
For demo the user name and the password is admin. You can change it as you want. Then I press proceed button.<br>
<br>
As you see a new page appears with the menu bar and the logo at the top.<br>
<br>
The menu bar gives you options Master, Transactions, Reports, Administration and Help. <br>
<br>
Here you can see most important four features of Gnukhata. For more details you can visit the site mentioned here http://gnukhata.org.<br>
<br>
There are a few basic house keeping tasks you will have to do now.<br>
<br>
Let's first understand the analogy of a master and a transaction.<br>
<br>
In master you have six options like Account creation, Customizable voucher and Bank Reconciliation .<br>
<br>
In Transactions you have option to enter different types of transactions like Contra, Journal, Payment, Receipt, Credit Note, Debit Note,<br> Sales, Purchase, Sales 
<br>
Return, Purchase Return and there is one more that is Other. etc.<br>
<br>
In this you can define your own transaction. <br>
<br>
Report option provides facility to display and print individual ledger accounts, trial balance, Balance sheet and profit and loss account<br>.
<br>
Administration option provides facilities for new user, change of password, take backup and restore database.  <br>
<br>
