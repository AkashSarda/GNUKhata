In menubar you have one option that is Reports. 

This option gives you Ledger, Trial Balance, Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Account. 

In case of Non profit organisation instead of profit and loss Account you will get Income and Expenditure Account. 

When I choose Ledger option from Reports, a new screen appears with the organisation name at the top.

Here you have to specify the name of the ledger account which you want to see. The first textbox asks you to give Account Name. 

I want to see salary account hence, I type salary as the Account name.  

Next field asks you for Period. 

You can ganarate these reports for any period you want but the period should begin with the first date of the  mentioned financial year.

Since I want to see ledger account for the whole period which is a default option.Now I press the View button. 

You are presented with a new screen. You see at the top the name of the organisation IITB. Below this Account Name at the left and period at the right.

The upper part gives you all the transactions chronologically that is date wise.

here the first row of the lower part of the table gives you total of Debit transactions and Credit transactions.  

The lower part gives you opening balance and closing balance.

The Grand total gives you the total of all transactions plus opening balance and credit balance.
